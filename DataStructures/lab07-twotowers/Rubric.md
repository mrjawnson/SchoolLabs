## Rubric

### Assignment is anonymous

[+] Submission should be anonymous (no name at top)

### Basics

[+] Assignment compiles

### Implementation

[+] Correct solution and second-best solution for towers of size 15

[+] Correct solution and second-best solution for towers of size 18

[+] Solution is space-efficient (should not store all possible solutions to find the best and second-best)

### Design

[+] Subset iterator uses a long to track current subset; does not convert to a String to determine the subset

[+] Uses bit operations rather than Math.pow()

[+] Properly uses generics

[+] Functionality is split into helper methods


### Style

[+] Checkstyle passes
