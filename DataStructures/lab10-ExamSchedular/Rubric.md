## General Comments

### Functionality

Good job, there are a reasonable number of slots for each input file.  Cool countdown timer.
Note that for the large file, the word `true` is repeatedly printed.  Debug output should
be removed from final submissions.

Nice work on multiple extensions!

### Design

Code is modular, and there are descriptive helper methods
